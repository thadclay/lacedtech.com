All Star weekend was crazy if for sneakerheads in or around NYC. There were too many places to be and not enough time to get to everything.

Luckily I was able to secure an early invite to an early shopping event at the Jordan 166 Flatbush popup store.
On top of that there were basketball related activities all throughout the city.
